1. Characteristics of Big data:
     * Volume – The name 'Big Data' itself is related to a size which is enormous.
              - Size of data plays very crucial role in determining value out of data. 
              - Hence, 'Volume' is one characteristic which needs to be considered while dealing with 'Big Data'.
     * Variety - Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured. 
               - During earlier days, spreadsheets and databases were the only sources of data considered by most of the applications.
               - Now days, data in the form of emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices, PDFs, audio, etc. is also being considered in the analysis applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
     * Velocity – The term 'velocity' refers to the speed of generation of data.
                - How fast the data is generated and processed to meet the demands, determines real potential in the data.
                - Big Data Velocity deals with the speed at which data flows in from sources like business processes, application logs, networks and social media sites, sensors, mobile devices, etc.
                - The flow of data is massive and continuous.


2. The possible solutions to handle Big:
     * Scale Up - Increase the configuration of a single system
     * Scale Out - Use multiple commodity machine and distribute the load of storage among them
            

3. The differences between scaling up and scaling out:
     * Scale up - refers to architectures that use a single, fixed resource controller for all processing
                - To add capacity, you attach disk-shelves up to the maximum for which the controller is rated
     * Scale out - refers to architectures that scale performance and capacity separately or in lockstep by not relying on a single controller, but instead provide processing power with each unit of disk
